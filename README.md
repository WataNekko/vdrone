# VDrone

Simulate making an Arduino-based quadcopter in Unity3D

## Motivation

A group of friends and I wanted to make a physical Arduino quadcopter project in our first year of uni but couldn't finish it for various reasons, so I decided to make a virtual one at home with Unity, simulating the process of making it with Arduino while learning Unity at the same time.
